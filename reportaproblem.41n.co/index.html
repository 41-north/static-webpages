<p>If you’re experiencing issues with a <strong>41N</strong> app or product, we want to hear about it! This page provides options for how to check on and/or report a problem you’ve found with one of our projects.</p>
<h2 id="🛠️-app-and-service-issues">🛠️ App and Service Issues</h2>
<p>If something isn’t working right in one of our apps/services, please check these items <strong>in order</strong>:</p>
<h3 id="🚦-1.-check-the-status-page">🚦 1. Check the status page</h3>
<p>Check our status page at <a href="https://status.41n.co">status.41n.co</a> to see if we’ve already reported any issues or problems. You can also check <a href="https://mstdn.social/@41n_status">@41n_status</a> on Mastodon.</p>
<h3 id="📧-2.-contact-support">📧 2. Contact support</h3>
<p>If you don’t see an issue already listed, reach out to support for assistance. You can find your support options at <a href="https://support.41n.co">support.41n.co</a>. This is the best option for the vast majority of issues that haven’t yet been reported on the status page.</p>
<h3 id="🚨-3.-trigger-an-emergency">🚨 3. Trigger an emergency</h3>
<p>If you are experiencing a critical outage with the service(s) such that multiple users are being impacted (multiple servers are down, multiple different websites won’t load from multiple different locations/ISPs, etc), you can page staff in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>If you are the only one experiencing the issue, it’s probably not an emergency. Our monitoring systems will alert us automatically to almost all system problems impacting users. <em>We don’t think you should have to use this option, we want this to be a fallback in case of a critical problem.</em></p>
<p>If you truly believe that you are experiencing a critical, time-sensitive issue that is impacting multiple customers, <a href="https://emergencypager.41nops.com">click here</a> and fill out the form to send an emergency page to staff.</p>
