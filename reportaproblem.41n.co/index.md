# 41 North: Report a Problem

If you're experiencing issues with a **41N** app or product, we want to hear about it! This page provides options for how to check on and/or report a problem you've found with one of our projects.

## 🛠️ App and Service Issues
If something isn't working right in one of our apps/services, please check these items **in order**:

### 🚦 1. Check the status page
Check our status page at [status.41n.co](https://status.41n.co) to see if we've already reported any issues or problems. You can also check [@41n_status](https://mstdn.social/@41n_status) on Mastodon.

### 📧 2. Contact support
If you don't see an issue already listed, reach out to support for assistance. You can find your support options at [support.41n.co](https://support.41n.co). This is the best option for the vast majority of issues that haven't yet been reported on the status page.

### 🚨 3. Trigger an emergency
If you are experiencing a critical outage with the service(s) such that multiple users are being impacted (multiple servers are down, multiple different websites won't load from multiple different locations/ISPs, etc), you can page staff in the event of an emergency.

If you are the only one experiencing the issue, it's probably not an emergency. Our monitoring systems will alert us automatically to almost all system problems impacting users. _We don't think you should have to use this option, we want this to be a fallback in case of a critical problem._

If you truly believe that you are experiencing a critical, time-sensitive issue that is impacting multiple customers, [click here](https://emergencypager.41nops.com) and fill out the form to send an emergency page to staff.
